🧠 Problem 03: Variables and Data Types (Core Java Basics)

Objective:
Understand how variables and primitive data types work in Java and how Java handles memory and type safety.

🔹 Tasks to Implement (WRITE CODE for ALL)

Declare variables of all primitive data types:

byte

short

int

long

float

double

char

boolean

Assign meaningful values to each variable.

Print each variable with a clear label, for example:

intValue = 10


Demonstrate implicit type casting

Assign a smaller data type to a larger one
(example: int → double)

Demonstrate explicit type casting

Assign a larger data type to a smaller one
(example: double → int)

Add comments explaining:

Why explicit casting is required

What data loss means in casting
