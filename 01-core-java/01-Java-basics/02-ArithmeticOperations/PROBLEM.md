## Problem 02: Arithmetic Operations

Write a Java program that performs:
- Addition of two numbers
- Subtraction of two numbers
- Multiplication of two numbers
- Division of two numbers

Print each result clearly with a label.
Save it.

🧠 STEP 2: Think Before Coding (IMPORTANT)
Decide (don’t code yet):

What two numbers will you use?

Will you use int or double?

How many println statements will you need?

Make the decision in your head first.

🧑‍💻 STEP 3: Create Java File
Create:
Arithmetic.java

Rules:

Class name = Arithmetic

One main method only

No extra methods

No user input yet (hardcode values)

🧩 STEP 4: Implement Operations
Inside main, perform:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Each output must have a label, for example:

Addition:
Subtraction:
(Exact wording is your choice — just be clear.)
