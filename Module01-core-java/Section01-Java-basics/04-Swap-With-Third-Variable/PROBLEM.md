# Problem 04 – Swap Two Numbers Using Third Variable

## Problem Statement
Write a Java program to swap two numbers using a third (temporary) variable.

## Requirements
1. Declare two integer variables `a` and `b`
2. Print their values before swapping
3. Use a third variable `temp` to swap the values
4. Print their values after swapping

## Constraints
- Use only int data type
- Use a third variable
- Do not use arithmetic tricks
- Do not take user input

## Expected Output (Example)
Before Swap: a = 10, b = 20  
After Swap: a = 20, b = 10
