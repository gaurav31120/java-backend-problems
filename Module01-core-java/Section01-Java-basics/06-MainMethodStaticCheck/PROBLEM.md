# Problem 06 – main Method Static Check

## Problem Statement
Understand why the main method in Java must be static.

## Tasks
1. Create a normal Java program with main method.
2. Remove the keyword `static` from the main method.
3. Try to compile and run the program.
4. Observe the error message.
5. Add comments in the code explaining:
   - What error you observed
   - Why the main method must be static
   - What the JVM tries to do while starting a program

## Constraints
- Do not fix the error by adding static back (for now)
- Focus on observation and explanation
- No Scanner, no logic changes
