📝 Notes (INTERVIEW-READY)
## Difference between JDK, JRE, JVM

- JDK: Used to develop Java programs
- JRE: Used to run Java programs
- JVM: Executes Java bytecode

Relationship:
JDK → JRE → JVM

## Java Execution Flow (Short Version)
1. Write .java file
2. Compile using javac → .class file
3. JVM loads class
4. JVM executes bytecode

## Why Java is platform independent?
Because Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on JVM instead of directly on OS.
