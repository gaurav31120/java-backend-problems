# Problem 07 – Class Name and File Name Mismatch

## Objective
Understand why a public class name must match the Java file name.

## Tasks
1. Create a Java file named `ClassNameFileNameMismatch.java`
2. Inside the file, declare a public class with a DIFFERENT name
3. Try to compile the program
4. Observe the compiler error
5. Write explanation in the code or Notes.md:
   - What error occurred
   - Why Java enforces this rule
   - What happens if the class is not public

## Expected Learning
- Java compile-time rules
- Relationship between public class and file name
- Difference between public and non-public classes
